# Project: Real-Time Streaming RAG Chat

## Goal

This project aims to build a functional real-time chat application enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), demonstrating how to combine WebSockets with AI-driven information retrieval and generation for live conversations.

## Project Units

This project is broken down into the following units. See each unit's README for details:

1.  **[Unit 1: RAG Fundamentals & Basic Demo](assignment1_llm_embeddings/README.md)** - Covers RAG concepts and includes a basic non-real-time demo.
2.  **[Unit 2: Real-Time WebSocket Chat](assignment2_websocket_chat/README.md)** - Builds the foundational real-time chat server and client.
3.  **[Unit 3: Integrating RAG with Real-Time Chat](assignment3_rag_chat_integration/README.md)** - (TBA) Focuses on combining RAG (Unit 1) with the chat system (Unit 2).
4.  **[Unit 4: Advanced RAG Techniques & Optimization](assignment4_advanced_rag/README.md)** - (TBA) Explores improvements to the RAG pipeline.
5.  **[Unit 5: User Interface Enhancements](assignment5_ui_ux/README.md)** - (TBA) Focuses on improving the chat UI/UX.
6.  **[Unit 6: Deployment & Scalability](assignment6_deployment/README.md)** - (TBA) Covers preparing the application for deployment.
