🔍 Answer:
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation and is a technique that enhances large language models by providing them with additional context retrieved from external sources before generating a response. The key components of RAG include reducing hallucinations by grounding responses in factual information, enabling access to domain-specific knowledge, updating model knowledge without retraining, improving transparency through citation of sources, and enhancing privacy by keeping sensitive data in controlled environments [Document 1].

❓ Question: What are vector databases and how do they work?

🔍 Answer:
Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and search vector embeddings efficiently. They are crucial for modern AI applications that utilize semantic search and similarity matching. Embeddings are numerical representations of data (text, images, audio) in a high-dimensional space [Document 1].

Vector databases work by performing operations such as indexing, similarity search using distance metrics like Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and dot product, approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms for speed, and filtering by combining vector search with metadata filtering [Document 2].
